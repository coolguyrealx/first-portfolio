            <p>I've completed both a Python 1 and 2 class, as well as a summer camp specifically for python. I could learn more, though I'm fairly confident in what I already know.</p>
            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <div class="progress-back">
                <div class="progress-front" style="height:24px;width:10%;animation-name:java-bar;">10%</div>
            </div>
            <p>I don't have very much experience with JavaScript, but it is something that I want to learn eventually,
                and have used at least a little before now.

            </div>
            <p>I'm about halfway through my first Web Development class, and while I know I probably have a lot more I can learn, I'm sure I can still make something fairly competent. (This website is evidence of that.)
