            <p>I don't just do programming, I have some hobbies and other interests too!
                for example, I really like playing rougelike games like The Binding of Issac or Hades.
                Other games I like include Hollow Knight, Red Dead Redemption I and II, Subnautica, and a few more that I really like, but maybe don't play as much.
                There should be an embed to my Steam profile below, if you want to give it a look.

            <p>Music is also a big interest of mine, since I took band for three years.
                I played the bass clarinet throughout all three years, and if you know what a clarinet is,
                it's basically just a lower, bigger, and more niche version of that.
            </p>
            <p>My favorite artist is Tyler The Creator, hands down. A lot of his songs are explicit, but if that doesn't bother you
                then I highly recommend checking him out if you haven't already.
