            <p>This is the website that me and a friend of mine made for a competition.
                It functions properly to my knowledge, and includes a few different features, including adding and removing transactions,
                and generating financial report charts using Chart.js.

            <p>This is an app I made in the Code.org App Lab for an AP project + test (which I got college credit on, btw)
                I'm fairly certain that App Lab uses JavaScript to make these programs. As you can probably see from the first screen, it includes music you can choose to play from, and a few different themes that spread across the entire app.
                The quiz itself is fairly basic, but still a little bit of a challenge.
