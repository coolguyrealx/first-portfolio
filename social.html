                Here's my GitHub! I have a couple of old repositories I used for school projects,
                and another repository that my friend made, which I've made a few contributions to.
                Here, I'll probably post more repositories as I continue to make other projects, so feel free to follow!
            </p>

            <p>
                As the link implies, this is my resume. To my knowledge, it is up to date
                and includes a few extra ways you can get in touch with me, as well as some info
                about me that may not be anywhere else.
